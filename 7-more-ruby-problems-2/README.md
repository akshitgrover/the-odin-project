#More Ruby Problems 2

Ruby problems that focus on implementing blocks to solve. The objective is to get better practice in using Ruby to solve programming problems. Specifically, the bubble sort algorithm is to be recreated as well as a variety of Ruby functions such as `#my_each`, `#my_each_with_index`, `#my_select`, `#my_all?`, `#my_any?`, `#my_none?`, `#my_count`, `#my_map`, and `#my_inject`.

####1 - Bubble Sort
Implement `#bubble_sort` and `#bubble_sort_by` methods

* `#bubble_sort`: takes an array and returns a sorted array using the bubble sorting algorithm
* `#bubble_sort_by`: sorts an array but takes a block. The array is assumed to be an array of strings and the array will be sorted according to word length

######To run:
```
cd 7-more-ruby-problems/1 - Bubble Sort
```
```
ruby bubble_sort.rb
```

######Results:
`#bubble_sort` method

`#bubble_sort_by` method

####2 - Enumerable Methods
Rebuild a variety of methods native to Ruby including, `#my_each`, `#my_each_with_index`, `#my_select`, `#my_all?`, `#my_any?`, `#my_none?`, `#my_count`, `#my_map`, and `#my_inject`.

* `#my_each`:
* `#my_each_with_index`:
* `#my_select`:
* `#my_all?`:
* `#my_any?`:
* `#my_none?`:
* `#my_count`:
* `#my_map`:
* `#my_inject`:
