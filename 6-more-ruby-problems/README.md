#More Ruby Problems

Slightly more involved Ruby problems from those in Exercise #4 - Ruby Problems. These practice problems are for a quick review of Ruby syntax and geeting used to some of the more intricate object methods in Ruby.

######1 - Caesar Cipher
Implement the Caesar Cipher (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string:

######2 - Stock Picker
Implement a method "stock_picker" that takes in an array of stock prices, one fror each hyppothtical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0. Note: you need to buy before you can sell.

######3 - Substrings

Implement a mthod "substring" that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as a second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how mant times it was found.

Make sure your method can handle multiple words.
