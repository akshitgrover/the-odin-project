#12 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Two programming problems that focus on the use of data structures (Binary Search Tree) and algorithms (breadth first search and depth first search algorithms) to solve problems. The first problem is to implement the binary tree data structure whereas the second exercise involves using algorithms to solve a practical problem. 

####1 - Searching Binary Trees

Create a program that implements the [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) data structure, to find a specific node in the tree structure. Both breadth first seach and depth first search was used.

######To run:
```
cd 12-data-structures-and-algorithms/1 - Searching Binary Trees
ruby binarytrees.rb
```

####2 - Knight's Travail

Create a program that will determine the shortest path that a Knight has to move in the game of chess to get from one square to another. 

######To run:
```
cd 12-data-structures-and-algorithms/2 - Searching Knights Travail
ruby knightstravail.rb
```
