#10 - More Ruby Problems 4

Two more general general programming problems, using Ruby, that focuses on using recursion to solve problems. The two problems to be recreated are the Fibonacci Sequence and Merge Sort. 

####1 - Fibonacci Sequence

Create a program that request an integer, n, and prints the nth value in the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The Fibonacci sequence sums each number with the one before it.
