#11 - More Ruby Problems 4

Two more general general programming problems, using Ruby, that focuses on using recursion to solve problems. The two problems to be recreated are the Fibonacci Sequence and Merge Sort. 

####1 - Fibonacci Sequence

Create a program that request an integer, n, and prints the 1 to n numbers in the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The Fibonacci sequence sums each number with the one before it.

######To run:
```
cd 11-more-ruby-problems-4/1 - Fibonacci Sequence
ruby fibonacci.rb
```

####2 - Merge Sort

Create a program that takes in an array and returns a sorted array using a recursive [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) methodology.

######To run:
```
cd 11-more-ruby-problems-4/2 - Merge Sort
ruby mergesort.rb
```

######Outcome:
```
The input array: [5, 2, 3, 1, 8, 6, 4, 5]
The output array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8]
```
